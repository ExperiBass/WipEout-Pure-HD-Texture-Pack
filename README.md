# WipEout Pure HD Textures Project
An Unofficial FX300 Anti-Gravity Racing League High-Resolution Textures Project for WipEout Pure.

For use with PPSSPP (PlayStation Portable Simulator Suitable for Playing Portably).
## Description :
A basic high-resolution textures pack which enhances the User-Interface of WipEout Pure.

For more information, please visit the PPSSPP forum thread : (todo)

## How to install
Download the repository as .zip then extract it to /ppsspp/memstick/PSP/TEXTURES/(gameid)

Make sure you enabled **Replace textures** in *Settings > Options > Developer tools* ; you can also go in *Control mapping* to map a button for **Texture replacement**, a quite efficient shortcut to compare with or without texture pack.

The Game ID is the unique identifier of each PlayStation game, it consists of 9 characters.

For WipEout Pure the textures pack supports the following:

- **UCES00001** : Europe
- **UCUS98612** : USA
- **UCJS10007** : Japan
- **ULES00229** : Europe (Demo)
- **ULUS10058** : USA (Demo)
